** innodb cluster

high availability solution for MySQL

consists of at least 3 MySQL server instances

1. mysql shell (advanced client and code editor for MySQL, cluster admin)
2. mysql server (work with group replication)
3. mysql router (a lightweight middleware provides transparent routing between your application and InnoDB cluster)

[[./images/innodb_cluster_overview.png]]

You work with InnoDB Cluster using the AdminAPI, provided as part of MySQL Shell.

AdminAPI is available in JavaScript and Python, and is well suited to scripting and automation of deployments of MySQL to achieve high-availability and scalability.

By using MySQL Shell's AdminAPI, you can avoid the need to configure many instances manually.

*** group replication

group replication provides features such as automatic membership management, fault tolerance, automatic fallover.

an InnoDB Cluster usually runs in a single-primary mode, with one primary instance(read-write) and multiple secondary instances(read-only).

advanced users can also take advantage of a multi-primary mode, where all instances are primaries.

*** mysql router

InnoDB Cluster is tightly integerated with MySQL Router.
you can use AdminAPI to work with them together

MySQL router can automatically configure itself based on an InnoDB Cluster, in a process called bootstrapping, which removes the need for you to configure routing manually.

MySQL Router then transparently connects client applications to the InnoDB Cluster, providing routing and load-balancing for client connections.

*** MySQL Clone

Using InnoDB Cluster, you can simply add an instance to the cluster and it is automatically provisioned.
