rental NFT, an extension of EIP-721

add a time-limited role with restricted permissions to EIP-721 tokens

it proposes an additional role (user) which can be granted to addresses, and a time where the role is automatically revoked (expires).

** motivation

there may be an owner of the NFT that rents it out to a "user".

the actions that a "user" should be able to take with an NFT would be different from the "owner".

it makes sense to have separate roles that identify whether an address represents an "owner" or a "user" and manage permissions to perform actions accordingly.

** specification

*** interface
